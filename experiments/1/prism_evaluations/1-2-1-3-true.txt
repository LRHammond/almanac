Transitions: 1682
Choices:     1681

Transition matrix: 1359 nodes (4 terminal), 1682 minterms, vars: 12r/12c/8nd

Building deterministic automaton (for X (F G "L0"))...
DRA has 3 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.212 seconds.

Constructing MDP-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 8 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)
Time for product construction: 0.004 seconds.

States:      215 (1 initial)

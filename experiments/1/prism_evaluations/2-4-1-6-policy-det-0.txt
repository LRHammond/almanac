Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 4 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.203 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      12 (1 initial)
Transitions: 17

Transition matrix: 286 nodes (8 terminal), 17 minterms, vars: 20r/20c

Building deterministic automaton (for X (F G "L0"))...
DRA has 3 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.3 seconds.

Constructing MC-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 4 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

States:      13 (1 initial)
Transitions: 18

Transition matrix: 363 nodes (8 terminal), 18 minterms, vars: 22r/22c

Finding accepting BSCCs...

SCCs: 2, BSCCs: 1, non-BSCC states: 11
BSCC sizes: 1:2

Computing reachability probabilities...

Prob0: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 13, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.36 seconds.

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 10 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000100, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.15 seconds.

Type:        MDP
States:      525 (1 initial)
Transitions: 3230
Choices:     3121

Transition matrix: 2144 nodes (34 terminal), 3230 minterms, vars: 16r/16c/7nd

Building deterministic automaton (for X (F G "L0"))...
DRA has 3 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.19 seconds.

Constructing MDP-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 10 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000100, setup 0.00)
Time for product construction: 0.007 seconds.

States:      555 (1 initial)
Transitions: 3590

Computing reachability probabilities...

Prob0A: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000600, setup 0.00)

Prob1E: 6 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000333, setup 0.00)

yes = 555, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.313 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)

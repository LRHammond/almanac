Transitions: 82

Transition matrix: 485 nodes (18 terminal), 82 minterms, vars: 18r/18c

Finding accepting BSCCs...

SCCs: 16, BSCCs: 16, non-BSCC states: 35
BSCC sizes: More than 10 BSCCs, use verbose mode to view sizes for all.

Computing reachability probabilities...

Prob0: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 67, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.329 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 8 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000125, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.233 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      81 (1 initial)
Transitions: 138

Transition matrix: 1432 nodes (72 terminal), 138 minterms, vars: 17r/17c

Building deterministic automaton (for X (G ("L0"|(F "L1"))))...
DRA has 5 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.154 seconds.

Constructing MC-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 8 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000125, setup 0.00)

States:      81 (1 initial)
Transitions: 138

Transition matrix: 1444 nodes (72 terminal), 138 minterms, vars: 20r/20c

Finding accepting BSCCs...

SCCs: 6, BSCCs: 5, non-BSCC states: 61
BSCC sizes: 1:2 2:12 3:2 4:2 5:2

Computing reachability probabilities...

Prob0: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.001000, setup 0.00)

yes = 81, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.206 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
